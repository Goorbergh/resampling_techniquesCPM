# Case study
Each subfolder in this folder contains all files to reproduce the case study presented in the main paper. The folder contains the following subfolders:
* Data, the IOTA data should be placed here
* Script, contains the R scripts to perform the case study
* Output, contains the results of the case study

To reproduce the results as descriped in the main paper, one should put the data (iota_utrecht.txt) in the data folder and then run the script_case_study.R file in the subfolder Script. This will result in a table with performance measures, saved as a .RDS file, and the calibration plots. Both are will be saved in the results subfolder.
